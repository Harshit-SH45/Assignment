      "Constantinople (see other names) became the capital of the Roman Empire during the reign of Constantine the Great in 330. Following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the late 5th century, Constantinople remained the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire (also known as the Byzantine Empire; 330–1204 and 1261–1453), the Latin Empire (1204–1261), and the Ottoman Empire (1453–1922). Following the Turkish War of Independence, the Turkish capital then moved to Ankara. Officially renamed Istanbul in 1930, the city is today the largest city in Europe, straddling the Bosporus strait and lying in both Europe and Asia, and the financial centre of Turkey.\n",
      "In 324, after the Western and Eastern Roman Empires were reunited, the ancient city of Byzantium was selected to serve as the new capital of the Roman Empire, and the city was renamed Nova Roma, or 'New Rome', by Emperor Constantine the Great. On 11 May 330, it was renamed Constantinople and dedicated to Constantine. Constantinople is generally considered to be the center and the \"cradle of Orthodox Christian civilization\". From the mid-5th century to the early 13th century, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe. The city became famous for its architectural masterpieces, such as Hagia Sophia, the cathedral of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which served as the seat of the Ecumenical Patriarchate; the sacred Imperial Palace, where the emperors lived; the Hippodrome; the Golden Gate of the Land Walls; and opulent aristocratic palaces. The University of Constantinople was founded in the 5th century and contained artistic and literary treasures before it was sacked in 1204 and 1453, including its vast Imperial Library which contained the remnants of the Library of Alexandria and had 100,000 volumes. The city was the home of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and guardian of Christendom's holiest relics such as the Crown of thorns and the True Cross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Constantinople was famous for its massive and complex fortifications, which ranked among the most sophisticated defensive architecture of antiquity. The Theodosian Walls consisted of a double wall lying about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) to the west of the first wall and a moat with palisades in front. Constantinople's location between the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara reduced the land area that needed defensive walls. The city was built intentionally to rival Rome, and it was claimed that several elevations within its walls matched Rome's 'seven hills'. The impenetrable defenses enclosed magnificent palaces, domes, and towers, the result of prosperity Constantinople achieved as the gateway between two continents (Europe and Asia) and two seas (the Mediterranean and the Black Sea). Although besieged on numerous occasions by various armies, the defenses of Constantinople proved impenetrable for nearly nine hundred years.\n",
      "In 1204, however, the armies of the Fourth Crusade took and devastated the city, and for several decades, its inhabitants resided under Latin occupation in a dwindling and depopulated city. In 1261 the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos liberated the city, and after the restoration under the Palaiologos dynasty, it enjoyed a partial recovery. With the advent of the Ottoman Empire in 1299, the Byzantine Empire began to lose territories, and the city began to lose population. By the early 15th century, the Byzantine Empire was reduced to just Constantinople and its environs, along with Morea in Greece, making it an enclave inside the Ottoman Empire. The city was finally besieged and conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1453, remaining under its control until the early 20th century, after which it was renamed Istanbul under the Empire's successor state, Turkey.\n",

particular school and Community for a long time so these are the parts that we have replaced we call them the bushes so these ones are already worn out and we have replaced them and this is what the Water Project do for communities affected by the lack of clean water and your donations go towards installations of new water projects just like this well and maintenance it's so clear to see how much these Wells mean to the kids the excitement the smells it's truly heartwarming but it does also tug at the [Music] heart it's crazy to think that one world like this can not only change the lives of these school kids but also the lives of the whole Community surrounding the [Music] school the school then surprised us with a whole dance routine before we had to leave wow wow well done well done [Music] wow the next school that we're going to is Shanda Primary School in which our next challenge will be given but like usual the welcome was insane [Music] [Applause] too much dancing from these people to what's going on right now I thought we be doing a war so our next challenge is to go and get water but it's not that easy the way we're going to get water is to go on a long difficult hike

can't wait before the hike begins we had to collect our canisters the walk has begun I'm actually proper injured what from the match yeah he's already making excuses so this is this is where people have to walk every day yeah every day and you know they would do it more than four times a day four times a day wow yeah it's very it's very the is very sh Australia remember Australia when we used to go on that thing yeah like that bro we're talking about Australia hey ja is touching me n touching me n's touching me Js this guy right here JS he's touching me now as we went off on this walk we all

what the locals had to do here every single day sometimes four or five times a day uh just to get some water before the worlds were built so you can see how much we're struggling so and now we have to all way back up that's the next that's the next task that's probably the hardest part hardest part of the whole thing walking back up I race my grandparents my grandparents are right there hey guys all right guys we've almost made it back finally bro that's killed me I can't lie to you I'm done see if I lives around here I'd never be the one that walks up get my little brother to do we're almost

can you take us to the well let's go to the well let's go let's go let's go and we just did the walk that the kids used to have to do but now as you can see the pump is a lot more close Clos to the school and they're getting safe secure clean water and that makes us very happy yes go yeah so the question is after that long walk who's the first person to drink some water me we all took turns taking a drink from the well however it seems that the school kids took humor from one person drinking how no they all just said that you were drinking it funny go drink again man but as we're about to leave the school and the local sent us on a way out with a party if you want to know how happy this water makes the kids is just have a look this is exactly why we wanted to come to Africa we wanted to see the work firsthand that the Water Project is doing all these kids deserve the whole world and clean water is the absolute minimum they all literally treated us like family and we can honestly say we'll never forget it our next challenge is to have matching f with our team partner which means we're splitting up guys all right damn man first time SPL split the whole video This is actually yeah so the teams are me and AJ and you three all right boys let's go got this let's go all right how long we win let's go get the D we've got 30 minutes to get off it and we've got a budget

to see it if that's the case and his time was slipping away we were losing hope we hadn't spotted any more of our animals starting to get dark now I'm starting to think that we might not actually capture all the animals we're pretty disappointed right now at this point our ra just jump in that river right now but then as it started getting dark we ended up encountering traffic oh my gosh
